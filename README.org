* Sum Correction Code
  Correct coincidence summing effects for a point source using the formalism of [[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/016890029090561J][Semkov 1990]].
  Note that this code does not concern itself with the emission rates or decay rates of sources.
  It expects to total and peak efficiencies to be derived from Monte-Carlo simulations, and then you
  can correct a measured peak intensity to a summing free peak intensity. Using the definitions of Semkov
  this is done using the expression:


$C_{ji} = \frac{[\mathbf{NAM}]_{ji}}{\mathbf{[N^{(0)}A^{(0)}M^{(0)}}]_{ji}}$


This correction matrix can then be applied to each of the measured transitions.
